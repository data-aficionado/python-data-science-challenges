* Understanding Python Basics with Day_1_Basics.py
- In this blog post, we will explore the basics of Python programming using the Day_1_Basics.py file. This file is a great resource for beginners to understand the fundamental concepts of Python.
* FizzBuzz
- One of the most interesting parts of the Day_1_Basics.py file is the implementation of the FizzBuzz program. FizzBuzz is a common programming task, often used in interviews to assess basic programming skills. The task is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
- In Day_1_Basics.py, FizzBuzz is implemented twice: once using a for loop and once using a while loop.
* FizzBuzz with a For Loop
- The for loop version of FizzBuzz starts by iterating over a range of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, if so, it prints "FizzBuzz". If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz", and if it's only divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz". If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it simply prints the number.
* FizzBuzz with a While Loop
- The while loop version of FizzBuzz works similarly to the for loop version. The main difference is that instead of iterating over a predefined range of numbers, it uses a counter that increments after each loop iteration. The loop continues until the counter reaches 100.
* Conclusion
- The Day_1_Basics.py file is a great resource for learning the basics of Python. The FizzBuzz examples demonstrate how to use for and while loops, as well as conditional statements, which are fundamental concepts in Python programming. By studying and experimenting with this file, beginners can gain a solid understanding of Python basics.

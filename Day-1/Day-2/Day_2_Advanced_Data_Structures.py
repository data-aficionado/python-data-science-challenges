# Lists: Description: Ordered and mutable collection of items.

# Lists are mutable ordered sequences of elements

# Lists are defined by square brackets

# Lists can contain any data type

# Lists can be nested

# Lists can be accessed by index

# Lists can be sliced

# Lists can be modified

# Lists can be sorted

# Lists can be reversed

# Lists can be concatenated

# Lists can be copied

# Lists can be extended

# Lists can be cleared

# Lists can be deleted

# Lists can be iterated over

# Lists can be converted to tuples

# Lists can be converted to sets

# Lists can be converted to dictionaries

# Lists can be converted to strings

# Lists can be converted to bytes

# Lists can be converted to byte arrays

# Lists can be converted to memory views

# Lists can be converted to generators

# Lists can be converted to iterators

# Lists can be converted to functions

# Lists can be converted to classes

# Lists can be converted to instances

# Lists can be converted to booleans

# Lists can be converted to integers

# Lists can be converted to floats

# Lists can be converted to complex numbers

# Lists can be converted to hexadecimals

# Lists can be converted to octals

# Lists can be converted to binaries

# Lists can be converted to ascii characters

# Lists can be converted to unicode characters

# Lists can be converted to objects

# Key list operations: append, extend, insert, remove, pop, index, count, sort, reverse.

# append: Adds an element at the end of the list

# extend: Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list

# insert: Adds an element at the specified position

# remove: Removes the item with the specified value

# pop: Removes the element at the specified position

# clear: Removes all the elements from the list

# index: Returns the index of the first element with the specified value

# count: Returns the number of elements with the specified value

# sort: Sorts the list

# reverse: Reverses the order of the list

# copy: Returns a copy of the list

# del: Deletes the list

# List comprehension: A concise way to create lists.

# List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.

# List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.

# Good to remember: However, we should avoid writing very long list comprehensions in one line to ensure that code is user-friendly.

# Every list comprehension can be rewritten in for loop, but every for loop canâ€™t be rewritten in the form of list comprehension.
